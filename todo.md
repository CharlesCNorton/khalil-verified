# Khalil-Verified: Outstanding Issues

1. Replace the per-foot `destruct f` proofs for zihāf syllable-count properties with general lemmas over arbitrary patterns (e.g., deleting a sākin from a well-formed letter sequence preserves syllable count for any pattern). **The contrast with the ʿilla count lemmas (which ARE general) makes this inconsistency conspicuous. The structural fact — "deleting a sākin never changes syllable count" — should be provable once over arbitrary well-formed letter sequences.**
2. Define a mora-counting function and prove that every applicable zihāf reduces total mora count.
3. Implement per-foot variation matching — try each legal variation on each foot independently rather than on the whole concatenated meter pattern.
4. Extend variant scanning to cover ṭayy, qabḍ, kaff, waqṣ, ʿaṣb, iḍmār, and all compound zihāf, not just khabn. **Currently `scan` only tries exact match + whole-meter khabn — a stub that would fail on the vast majority of classical Arabic poetry.**
5. Formalize the legal zihāf/ʿilla combinations per meter — which variations are traditionally permitted at which positions in which meters. Currently the variation functions are generic (any zihāf on any foot), but the tradition restricts which variations are actually legal in each meter. Without this, combinatorial scansion (item 7) will over-generate false matches.
6. Implement combinatorial scansion — match input against the Cartesian product of per-foot variant possibilities.
7. Enrich `scan_result` to report which variation was applied at which foot position.
8. Prove scansion soundness: if `scan` returns `ScanVariant m`, the input is a legal variant of meter `m`.
9. Prove scansion completeness: if a pattern is any legal single-variation of a meter, `scan` finds it.
10. Add ambiguity detection — flag when a pattern matches more than one meter with or without variation.
11. Formalize taqṭīʿ: given a meter and a flat syllable pattern, recover the foot-boundary segmentation.
12. Revise `is_valid_bayt` to accept hemistichs with legal zihāf in ḥashw positions and ʿilla in ʿarūḍ/ḍarb, rather than demanding exact meter-pattern match. **As-is, `is_valid_bayt` rejects the vast majority of real classical Arabic poetry, since virtually every line uses at least one variation. This makes the poem-structure section (Section 9) largely decorative until fixed.**
13. Revise `is_valid_qasida` to use variation-aware bayt validity.
14. Make `is_well_formed_rhyme` check adjacency constraints (ridf must immediately precede rawīy), not just relative ordering.
15. Replace the abstract `rhyme_id = nat` with a type derived from actual rawīy consonant and vowel identity, connecting rhyme elements to rhyme identity. **Currently rhyme is entirely abstract — `nat` equality says nothing about phonological content. The rhyme section proves structural properties of a type that doesn't model what rhyme actually is.**
16. Make `is_matla_proper` verify phonological rhyme content rather than abstract nat equality.
17. Enforce poem non-emptiness at the type level or make `is_valid_poem` reject empty lists. (`qasida` record enforces non-emptiness; `is_valid_poem` on plain `poem` type still accepts `[]`.)
18. Formalize poem sub-genres (ghazal, rubāʿī, maqṭūʿa) as structural predicates over the `poem` type.
19. Strengthen witnesses and counterexamples so that each one tests a property the universal lemma does NOT already guarantee — e.g., boundary cases, off-by-one positions, interaction between operations, or coverage of all constructors. **The file is roughly 50% examples, but most add zero assurance beyond the preceding lemma (e.g., `weight_eq_dec_witness` after `weight_eq_dec` is already `Defined`). The fix is not to delete them but to make each one earn its keep: test a distinct failure mode, exercise a different code path, or verify a composite property that no single lemma covers.**
20. Add `Extraction` directives for the core computable functions (`scan`, `pattern_to_meter`, `apply_khabn`, etc.) to OCaml or Haskell, enabling use outside Coq. **Without extraction, the formalization is a proof artifact only — it cannot be called from real software.**
21. Build an extracted test harness that runs the scanner against known syllable-weight transcriptions of classical Arabic verses (e.g., the opening of the Muʿallaqa of Imruʾ al-Qays in Ṭawīl). **Without this, the formalization proves internal consistency but not correspondence to reality. The meter definitions themselves are unverified against real poetry — if a foot sequence is wrong, all proofs still pass. This is the single most important validation step.**
