# Khalil-Verified: Outstanding Issues

1. Replace each trivial `Example` block with a substantive test: boundary cases, off-by-one positions, cross-operation interactions, or full constructor coverage.
2. Generalize mutaḥarrik-modifying lemmas to pattern-general forms analogous to `delete_sakin_preserves_count`.
3. Prove compound zihāf simultaneous deletion equivalent to (or intentionally distinct from) sequential composition.
4. Generalize `rotate_add_mod` to arbitrary naturals, removing the `n ≤ length p` and `m ≤ length p` preconditions.
5. Add meter-specific ḥashw refinements to `foot_permitted_zihaf`.
6. Formalize poem sub-genres (ghazal, rubāʿī, maqṭūʿa) as structural predicates over `poem`.
7. Introduce `SuperLong` weight to distinguish tarfīl from tadhyīl. Do last — touches everything.
8. Add `Extraction` directives for core computable functions to OCaml or Haskell.
9. Build an extracted test harness against classical Arabic verse transcriptions.
