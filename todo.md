# Khalil-Verified: Outstanding Issues

1. Add Ltac automation for exhaustive case splits on `foot`, `meter`, `zihaf`, `ʿilla`, and `compound_zihaf`.
2. Replace each trivial `Example` block with a substantive test: boundary cases, off-by-one positions, cross-operation interactions, or full constructor coverage.
3. Generalize mutaḥarrik-modifying lemmas to pattern-general forms analogous to `delete_sakin_preserves_count`.
4. Prove compound zihāf simultaneous deletion equivalent to (or intentionally distinct from) sequential composition.
5. Generalize `rotate_add_mod` to arbitrary naturals, removing the `n ≤ length p` and `m ≤ length p` preconditions.
6. Add meter-specific ḥashw refinements to `foot_permitted_zihaf`.
7. Formalize poem sub-genres (ghazal, rubāʿī, maqṭūʿa) as structural predicates over `poem`.
8. Introduce `SuperLong` weight to distinguish tarfīl from tadhyīl. Do last — touches everything.
9. Add `Extraction` directives for core computable functions to OCaml or Haskell.
10. Build an extracted test harness against classical Arabic verse transcriptions.
